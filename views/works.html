        <h3>Psychiatric Center of Engenho de Dentro</h3>
        <article>In 1944 she was reinstated to the public service and began her work at the Pedro II National Psychiatric Center, in Engenho de Dentro, in Rio de Janeiro, where she resumed her fight against psychiatric techniques that she considered aggressive to patients.

            Due to her disagreement with the methods adopted in the wards, refusing to apply electroshocks to patients, Nise da Silveira was transferred to work with occupational therapy, an activity then underestimated by doctors. Thus, in 1946 he founded the "Occupational Therapy Section" at that institution.
            
            In place of the traditional cleaning and maintenance tasks that patients performed under the title of occupational therapy, she created painting and modeling workshops with the intention of enabling patients to resume their links with reality through symbolic expression and creativity, revolutionizing the Psychiatry then practiced in the country.</article>
        <h3 class="second">The Museum of Images of the Unconscious</h3>
        
        <article>In 1952, she founded the Museum of Images of the Unconscious, in Rio de Janeiro, a study and research center aimed at preserving the works produced in the modeling and painting studios she created at the institution, valuing them as documents that opened up new possibilities for a deeper understanding of the schizophrenic's inner universe.

            Among other artist-patients who created works incorporated in the collection of this institution, Adelina Gomes, Carlos Pertuis, Emygdio de Barros and Octávio Inácio can be mentioned.
            
            This valuable collection fueled the writing of his book "Imagens do Unconsciente", films and exhibitions, participating in significant exhibitions, such as "Mostra Brasil 500 Anos".
            
            Between 1983 and 1985, filmmaker Leon Hirszman made the film "Imagens do Unconsciente", a trilogy showing works made by inmates from a script created by Nise da Silveira.</article>
